# Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nimesh!

I am an engineering graduate with a passion for UX design. I have sufficient experience working with front-end technologies such as ReactJS and Flutter. Recently, I worked as a UX + QA engineer with Brane Enterprises to address issues in the functionality of a PaaS product. Essentially, consider me an all-rounder!

I am always interested in advocating for user problems. Recently, I discovered an interest in focusing on broader aspects such as usability, accessibility, and equity of digital products.

I am also a University Innovation Fellow from the d.school at Stanford University and have coached two university cohorts from Indonesia in design thinking.
